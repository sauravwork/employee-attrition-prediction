# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project predicts whether an employee will leave the company using machine learning models.  
The dataset used is **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition**.

---

## üìñ Description
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations. Using employee data such as job role, salary, years at company, and work-life balance, this project applies **machine learning** to predict the likelihood of attrition.

## üöÄ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoded categorical features  
   - Handled class imbalance  
   - Scaled numerical features  

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
   - Visualized attrition trends  
   - Plotted correlations  
   - Checked feature importance  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - XGBoost  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - ROC-AUC Curve
